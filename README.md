# 32-Bits-Sequential-MAX-Circuit

**Task**

This repo describes the design of a sequential MAX circuit for eight unsigned 4-bit numbers (X0..X7). The circuit takes these eight inputs and outputs the maximum among the eight numbers. The report outlines the design approach and provides a transistor-level schematic for the core sorting element.
